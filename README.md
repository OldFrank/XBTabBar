# XBTabBar

This is a sample project that demonstrates a hack to place a custom tabBar wherever you want still using a UITabBarController so that you don't have to crank up your own view controller management which might not be a good idea..

Do whatever you want with it...if you care about license, lets choose the less restrictive one which is MIT as far as I know.
