# XBTabBar

This is a sample project that demonstrates a hack to place a custom tabBar wherever you want still using a UITabBarController so that you don't have to make your own view controller management which might not be a good idea..

The XBTabBarView class is not intended to be used directly in your project. It is instead just an example that shows how to do that. In case it satisfies your needs go ahead and use it.

Do whatever you want with it...if you care about license, lets choose the less restrictive one which is MIT as far as I know.
